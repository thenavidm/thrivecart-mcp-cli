# Security

## Reporting

Found a vulnerability? [Report it privately](https://github.com/thenavidm/thrivecart-mcp-cli/security/advisories/new). Not as a public issue.

## What this server holds

1 or more ThriveCart API keys, read from environment variables at startup and held in memory for the process lifetime. Nothing is written to disk, cached, or sent anywhere except `thrivecart.com`.

A ThriveCart API key reaches the whole account, including refunds and cancellations. There is no read-only key and no scope system upstream, so the key you give this server is the key to the till. Treat it like a password.

## The write-safety model

Writes work by default, because a server where every write needs a flag teaches the flag to be passed reflexively.

| Control | Effect |
|---|---|
| Approval | Required by `cancel_subscription` and `refund_transaction`, which cannot be undone. Over MCP a person approves each where the client can ask; elsewhere the model must pass `confirm: true`, and `THRIVECART_CONFIRM=model` allows that everywhere |
| `THRIVECART_ALLOW_DESTRUCTIVE=0` | Those two refuse. Pause, resume and create_affiliate still work |
| `THRIVECART_READ_ONLY=1` | All five write tools are removed from the tool list entirely |
| `THRIVECART_AUDIT_LOG=<path>` | One JSON line per attempted write, allowed or blocked, with who approved it, written `0600` |

Read-only is the right setting for any agent you are not supervising.

## Running over HTTP

`--http` binds `127.0.0.1` by default, deliberately, and refuses any other address without `THRIVECART_HTTP_TOKEN`, which it then requires as a bearer token. Otherwise anyone who can reach the port could refund your customers.

The transport is stateless: one transport per request, closed with the response, so there is no session table to leak or grow.

## Prompt injection

Product names, customer names and affiliate details are attacker-influenceable text. This server returns them as data and its instructions tell the model to treat them as data. A model driving these tools should never act on instructions found inside a product title.

## Good-faith research

Read, run and pull apart anything here. Nobody but the maintainer can change
this repository, so nothing you do while investigating puts it at risk.

The care is owed to the service the tool talks to, not to the code. When
testing, use your own account and your own data. Do not point it at somebody
else's, and do not hammer a shared API to the point where other people notice.
If a test could affect anyone but you, stop and send a private report first.

Research done in that spirit is welcome, and nothing here is a trap.

## Supported versions

Fixes go to the latest published version.
